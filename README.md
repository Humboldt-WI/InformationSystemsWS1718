# Seminar Information Systems WS 1718

We will collect the code and tutorials centrally in this repository. Please 

- Create a Github account
- Fork the repository (create a copy on your account)
- Clone the repository (create a copy of the files on your computer)
- Save all your files in a folder named after your topic, e.g. CNN_introduction. 
- Collaborate on your version with Github as introduced in BADS and on the web.
- At the end of the seminar, create a pull request (Github will ask me if I want to merge your folder into the seminar repository)

This is the process used for most open source and many coding-heavy, collaborative company projects.

A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate.
