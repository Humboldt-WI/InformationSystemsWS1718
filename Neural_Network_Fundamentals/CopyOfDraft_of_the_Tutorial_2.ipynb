    "This blog post is a guide to help readers build a neural network from the very basics. It starts with an introduction to the concept of a neural networks concept and its early development. A step-by-step coding tutorial follows, through which relevant concepts are illustrated. Later in the post, there is also an introduction on how to build neural networks in Keras. Finally, the reader will find instructions on how to deploy the model via an API to make it accessible to anyone interested on it."

    "As the name tells, the idea of neural networks is inspired by how neurons work in the human brain. It is, however, crucial for the readers to know that despite the original motivation of neural networks, the NN models being used today have little resemblance to what a human brain does ???(Warner and Misra, 1996).  In its basic form, neural networks are composed of nodes interconnected to each other in several layers. The basic form of a NN would include an input, a hidden and an output layer. The number of nodes and layers can add to the complexity and efficiency of neural networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The McCulloch-Pitts model of neuron in 1943 was one of the earliest simplified version of neural networks. It consisted of a simple neuron which received a weighted sum of inputs and output either zero if the sum was smaller than a threshold or one when it was greater than the threshold. This idea is called firing and is an interesting analogy to what an actual neuron does. Later on, in the early 1960s, Rosenblatt introduced the simple perceptron model. This was a developed version of the McCulloch-Pitts with an input and output layer. However, the linear separablilty limitation ???(Minsky and Papert ,1969) of simple perceptron took away the research interest in neural networks for a while. In the early 1980s, the Hopfield model of content-addressable memory, however, motivated researchers in the area again and later on with the introduction of backpropagation learning algorithm, interest in neural networks research soared. Nowadays, neural nets are used in a variety of applications to tackle problems such as classification, speech and image recognition, control systems and predictions.\n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The best way to understand how neural networks work is to build one yourself from scratch.\n",
    "The understanding becomes even more comprehensive if there is a particular problem that can be solved using NNs. Therefore let's start our work by taking a look at the picture below."

    "There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly classify. This would be an easy task for a person but at least for a long period of time was an extremely complicated one for a machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain outperforms the computer in some other tasks. Many of those tasks are related to the human ability for sentience (which is a concept different from intelligence). The trick is to find a way, so that the computer could apply its numeric computation skills to solve these later tasks (at least to some degree).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step would be to limit the scope of the task. In our particular case the broad task of image recognition will be addressed as a classification problem - a task of giving an object a label from a given set of labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see during the process of building our own NN, its output is based almost exclusively on application of linear algebra methods. Despite the name (which is sometimes related to the fear of artificial intelligence), neural networks in fact are much more related to statistical methods (like regression analysis or curve fitting) than to the way human brain works [[Stuart Reid, 2014](http://www.turingfinance.com/misconceptions-about-neural-networks/)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "NNs are inspired by human brain only to certain extent. For instance the main element that makes them similar is a multilayer net structure of simple elements that are connected in some way, receiving and transmitting information. But the structure of the human brain is much more complicated, besides it is self-organizing and adaptive in contrast to the fixed manually designed architecture of a NN. Hence, there is a good reason to stop being afraid of neural networks and instead to create one ourselves."

    "**Nodes.** A node is basically a point where data points are received, processed and then transferred to the node. A node could be either an endpoint or a redistribution point or even both when iterations are done through the learning algorithm. The number of nodes to use is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layers.** A layer consists of one or several nodes. The initial layer in the network is called the input layer and it is the entry point through which the data is fed into the neural net. The middle layers are called hidden layer because the computation results of them are not directly visible to someone interacting with the neural net. In the hidden layers, which can range from one to thousands, the features are transformed and most of the structure (both linear and nonlinear) is captured. Finally, there is the final layer, from which results are output. The nodes in each layer are fully interconnected to the ones in the next and the previous layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we have a structure with 3 layers: input, output and one hidden layer. The number of nodes in the input  (\"i_n\"), hidden (\"h_n\") and output (\"o_n\") layers are 3, 5 and 2 respectively. In Python, such a structure can be represented in the following way:"

The smaller the steps - the more accurate will be the prediction. At the same time it might take more time to learn."

    "It is much easier to train neural networks where the number of neurons is larger than required. But, with a smaller number of neurons the neural network has much better generalization abilities. It means it will respond correctly for patterns not used for training. If too many neurons are used, then the network can be overtrained on the training patterns, but it will fail on patterns never used in training. With a smaller number of neurons, the network cannot be trained to very small errors, but it may produce much better approximations for new patterns. The most common mistake made by many researchers is that in order to speed up the training process and to reduce the training errors, they use neural networks with a larger number of neurons than required. Such networks would perform very poorly for new patterns not used for training."

    "## Sigmoid function: \n",
    "This function squashes the input value into a vaule in the range of [0,1]. It is powerful to compute bolean functions and the smoothness of sigmoid allows for better approxmiation (Schnitger & DasGupta, 1993). However, there are two major drawbacks. First, the sigmoid outputs 0 for high negative values and 1 for high positive values and this results in no signal flows from the nodes because the gradient at these two tails are 0. Second, its output is not centered at 0. This would ultimately result in either all positive gradients on weighte or all negative during the backpropogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tangent hyperbolic: \n",
    "Unlike to sigmoid, this function’s output is zero centered and outputs a value in the range of [-1,1]. Although it is more preferred over sigmoid but it sufferes from the same problem because it kills the gradient descent at high or low values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ReLU: \n",
    "This function is zero whenever input is negative and when the input is positive, its begavior is linear with slope 1. According to Glorot et al. (2011), the ReLU activation functions outperform sigmoidal functions in Deep Neural Networks on text classification and image recognition tasks. ReLU also excells the sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic in accelerating the stochastic gradient descent convergance. However, the ReLU is not prone to the training process and the nodes can die. This means that if a large gradient runs through the nodes, it may update the weights in a way that the node will never be active for any inputs again and this will result in gradient of zero from that node onward."

    "# Gradient Descent:\n",
    "Gradient descent is one the most poppular algorithms to optimize the neural networks. The name gradient descent is rooted in the procedure where the gradient is repeadtedly evaluated to update the parameters.The objective of the gradient descent is to find weight parameters which will minimize the cost function. In this paper, the focus is mainly on Mini-batch Gradient Descent and the Stochastic Gradient Descent. The Mini-batch Gradient Descent (BGD) is used when there is a large scale training data set where the computation of the cost function over the whole training data set is computationaly expensive. Therefore, a batch of the training data set, say 250 observations, is randomly selected to compute the gradient with the assumption that the observations in the training dataset are correlated. If this procedure is done only for one observation instead of 250, but with 250 iterations, then this procedure is called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) but it is not a common approach since it is not efficient to evaluate the gradient 250 times for one observation than iterating one time over 250 observations."
